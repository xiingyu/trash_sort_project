The dataset includes 1156 images.
Trash are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
* Random shear of between -15째 to +15째 horizontally and -15째 to +15째 vertically
* Random exposure adjustment of between -11 and +11 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 2.5 pixels
